# Sylvan's Config files 
A wealth of deep-cut knowledge, relatable workflow obsessors, and a great way
to waste all of your time. Be careful with this stuff kids (I'm also a kid). 

Please drop an issue, share your own config, hate on me, roast my code, ask
why. The biggest way you can support my Youtube efforts is not money (yet), but
rather sharing and supporting this repo. I want your expertise not your money;
support me with info, and spread the ergo love. Make this repository famous,
that would make me very happy and wouldn't cost you anything. A share, a star, 
a reference to a friend or colleague are all free, and that's all I ask!
Rember, I've never made you listen to a sponsorship haha. Man I hate begging.
